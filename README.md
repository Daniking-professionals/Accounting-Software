# Accounting-Software

## 📌 Project Description  
**Accounting-Software** is a simple Python-based accounting system designed to manage:  

- ✅ Inventory Control & Inventory Management  
- ✅ Cash Management  
- ✅ Bank Account Reconciliation Statement  
- ✅ Value Added Tax (VAT) Computation  
- ✅ Payroll Management  
- ✅ Statement of Profit or Loss Computation  

This project is developed as part of my **Python Essentials 1 Course (Python Institute)** final project.  
It focuses on simplicity, readability, and practical implementation of Python fundamentals.
